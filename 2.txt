The important features of **encapsulation** in Java are designed to enhance data protection, maintainability, and usability. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at these features:

### Important Features of Encapsulation

1. **Access Modifiers**:
   - **Private**: Used to restrict access to the class's internal state. Members marked `private` are only accessible within the same class.
   - **Protected**: Allows access within the same package and by subclasses, providing a controlled way of exposing class members.
   - **Public**: Members marked `public` can be accessed from any other class. While this increases accessibility, it should be used cautiously to avoid exposing sensitive data.

2. **Getter and Setter Methods**:
   - **Getters**: Methods that allow read-only access to private fields. They return the current value of the field.
   - **Setters**: Methods that allow modifying the value of private fields. They can include validation logic to ensure the data remains consistent.

3. **Data Hiding**:
   - Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of a class from outside interference and misuse. This prevents direct modification of fields and ensures that data integrity is maintained.

4. **Controlled Access**:
   - By using getters and setters, you can control how the data is accessed and modified. This provides a level of abstraction and allows for additional logic to be executed when data is accessed or updated.

5. **Flexibility and Maintainability**:
   - Encapsulation allows you to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting code that uses the class, as long as the public interface remains the same. This promotes flexibility and makes the code easier to maintain.

6. **Abstraction**:
   - Encapsulation supports abstraction by providing a clear interface for interaction with the class while hiding the complex implementation details. This simplifies the interaction with the class and reduces the complexity of the system.

7. **Modularity**:
   - Encapsulation promotes modularity by organizing data and methods into self-contained units (classes). Each class can be developed, tested, and debugged independently, which enhances code organization and reusability.

8. **Encapsulation of State and Behavior**:
   - Encapsulation not only hides the internal state but also groups related state and behavior together. This helps in creating a well-defined interface for the class that encapsulates both data and the methods that operate on that data.

### Example Demonstrating Encapsulation Features

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private fields
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Getter for account number
    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter for balance
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Setter for balance with validation
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Method to withdraw funds with validation
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of BankAccount
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456", 1000.00);

        // Accessing account details using getters
        System.out.println("Account Number: " + account.getAccountNumber());
        System.out.println("Initial Balance: " + account.getBalance());

        // Modifying balance using setters
        account.deposit(500.00);
        System.out.println("Balance after deposit: " + account.getBalance());

        // Withdrawing funds
        boolean success = account.withdraw(200.00);
        System.out.println("Withdrawal successful: " + success);
        System.out.println("Balance after withdrawal: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Encapsulation** in Java involves bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- **Access Modifiers** control visibility.
- **Getters and Setters** provide controlled access to private fields.
- **Data Hiding** and **Controlled Access** ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Flexibility** and **Maintainability** are enhanced by allowing changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code.
- **Abstraction** simplifies interaction by hiding implementation details.
- **Modularity** and **Encapsulation of State and Behavior** promote a well-organized and reusable code structure.

Encapsulation is a core principle of object-oriented design that helps manage complexity and maintain the robustness of your software.
